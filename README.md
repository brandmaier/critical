# jamovi plugin: critical value

This is a plugin for [jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org/). The plugin is meant for teaching introductory stats courses to help students compute the critical value for standard distributions instead of having to learn to lookup values in tables. It basically wraps the quantile and density functions of R and adds some visual output.
